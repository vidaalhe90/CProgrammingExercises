# C Programming Exercises

This repository contains programming exercises corresponding to several textbooks.
At this point the following books are considered:

1. C How to Program, 9th edition by Paul Deitel & Harvey Deitel
2. The C Programming Language, 2nd edition by Dennis Ritchie
3. Introduction to Java Programming, 11th by Daniel Y. Liang

The main idea is to explore several topics using the C programming language to solve
related exercises (even exercise are taken from non C programming language textbooks).
